# SOEN341-MessagingApp

## Objective

Develop a messaging app that allows users to send messages to each other through channels or individually. The application will have the following features:

- User authentication
- Text Channels for Group Communication
  - Users can join a set of channels (e.g., "General," "Project Help," "Social").
  - Messages sent in a channel are visible to all users in that channel.
- Direct Messaging Between Users
  - Users can join a predefined set of channels (e.g., "General," "Project Help," "Social").
- Role-Based User Permissions
  - Two roles: Admin and Member.
  - Admins can create/delete channels and moderate messages (delete inappropriate ones).
  - Members can only send and view messages.
- Last feature to come.
